  # The app is not yet notarized with a Developer ID. Without these steps

  caveats <<~EOS
    BlindSpot is a menu-bar app — there's no Dock icon by design.
    Launch it once with:
      open -a BlindSpot

    Required permission on first launch:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable BlindSpot

    To update: brew update && brew upgrade --cask blindspot
